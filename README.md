**RB - VOLUMEBOT V 1.5.9**



Need a little boost in terms of Volume?
Need to get to the top 5 spots on Dextools?

Exclude the bot from the taxes on your contract, set your timing and VolumeBot will take care of the rest!
Only the on-chain taxes will be paid.

**EASY TO SET UP**

One of the easiest to read interfaces. Fill the boxes, connect and launch.

**SET A BNB THRESHOLD**

Set a Max of BNB to be used by the bot every 24h. This gives you full control over the Volume generated.


**SET BUY OR SELL .. OR BOTH!**

You can decide whether the bot makes buys or sells. Why not both?

**ORGANIC LOOK**

You can also make it look like more organic by randomizing the buy/sells.
You can specify the minutes in-between the buys and sells are made.

**SET LIMIT**

Set a Threshold to how many BNBs are used on that wallet per day.

**MULTISESSION**

You can open up the App as many times as you want. You just need a powerful enough PC.

**UPDATES**

App gets constantantly updated with new features and improvements.
